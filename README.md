#  Python Bindings for Yices 2

## Installation

Once you have installed the [Yices SMT Solver](http://yices.csl.sri.com/), you can install
the python language bindings by simply installing the pip package:
```
pip install yices
```

The python API is very closely tied to the yices C API, see [yices.h](http://yices.csl.sri.com//blob/master/src/include/yices.h).
