Let x be a vector of integer and real variables. Suppose we want to
solve a set of constraints C[x] while minimizing the value of f[x].

One simple strategy is to first find an initial solution x0 to C:

C[x0]

then iteratively find x1, x2, x3, x4 ....

such that

C[x{n+1}]  and f(x{n+1}) < f(xn) - delta

for some suitable delta.
